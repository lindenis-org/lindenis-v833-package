	bool "Curve25519 support"
	default y
	help
		This enables the following key exchange algorithm:
		  curve25519-sha256@libssh.org

		Increases binary size by about 13 kB uncompressed (MIPS).

config DROPBEAR_ECC
	bool "Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)"
	default n
	help
		Enables elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) support in key exchange and public key
		authentication.

		Key exchange algorithms:
		  ecdh-sha2-nistp256
		  ecdh-sha2-nistp384
		  ecdh-sha2-nistp521

		Public key algorithms:
		  ecdsa-sha2-nistp256
		  ecdsa-sha2-nistp384
		  ecdsa-sha2-nistp521

		Does not generate ECC host keys by default (ECC key exchange will not be used,
		only ECC public key auth).

		Increases binary size by about 23 kB (MIPS).
