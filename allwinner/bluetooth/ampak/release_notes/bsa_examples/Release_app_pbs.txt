This package contains the Bluetooth Application PBAP server (app_pbs) on Linux.

To compile the Bluetooth PBAP server application you have to type:
> cd 3rdparty/embedded/bsa_examples/linux/app_pbs/build
> make			<= For PC/Linux target (default)
> make CPU=mips		<= For MIPS/Linux target

For PC/Linux target, the application executable is located in build/x86 folder.
To execute it, you have to go in the folder used to start the server application:
> cd  ../../server/build/
> ../../app_pbs/build/x86/app_pbs

In fact both server and applications need to access the named socket file (bt-daemon-socket),
which is created when the server is started.

For MIPS target, the application executable is located in build/mips folder.
To execute it, you have to copy and to execute it on the MIPS platform (from the same location used to execute the bt_server).

Ensure that the application side has been built with the following setting in app_pbs.txt
	BSA_PBS_INCLUDED = TRUE
Ensure that the server side has been built with the following setting in bte_server.txt
	BTA_PBS_INCLUDED = TRUE

For testing, ensure that the folder used to start the server application contains a folder called /pictures/telecom that contains the phonebook data.
> cd ../../server/build/
> mkdir pictures
> cp telecom -rv pictures
The telecom dir is available from the following location in the Clearcase Projects VOB:
   /Projects/bta/insight/btui_app/test_files/pbs/telecom
Use BTE Insight PBAP Client to Pull the /telecom phonebook from the PBAP server application.
