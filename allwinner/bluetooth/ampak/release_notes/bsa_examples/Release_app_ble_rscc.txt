This package contains the BLE RSC(Running speed and cadence) controller (app_ble_rscc) on Linux.

To compile the BLE rscc, have to type:
> cd 3rdparty/embedded/bsa_examples/linux/app_ble_rscc/build
> make              <= For PC/Linux target (default)
> make CPU=mips     <= For STB/Linux target

For PC/Linux target, the application executable is located in build/x86 folder.
To execute it, you have to go in the folder used to start the server application:
> cd  ../../server/build/
> ../../app_ble_pm/build/x86/app_ble_rscc

In fact both server and applications need to access the named socket file (bt-daemon-socket),
which is created when the server is started.

For STB target, the application executable is located in build/mips folder.
To execute it, you have to copy and to execute it on the STB platform (from the same location used to execute the bt_server).
