This package contains the Bluetooth MAP Client (app_mce) on Linux.

To compile the Bluetooth MAP client sample application you have to type:
> cd 3rdparty/embedded/std/linux/app_mce/build
> make          <= For PC/Linux target (default)
> make CPU=mips     <= For MIPS/Linux target

For PC/Linux target, the application executable is located in build/x86 folder.
To execute it, you have to go in the folder used to start the server application:
> cd  ../../server/build/
> ../../app_mce/build/x86/app_mce

Both server and applications need to access the named socket file (bt-daemon-socket),
which is created when the server is started.

For mips based embeded target, the application executable is located in build/mips folder.
To execute it, you have to copy and to execute it on the target platform (from the same location used to execute the bsa_server).

Ensure that the application side has been built with the following setting in app_mce.txt
    BSA_MCE_INCLUDED = TRUE
Ensure that the server side has been built with the following setting in bte_server.txt
    BTA_MCE_INCLUDED = TRUE
