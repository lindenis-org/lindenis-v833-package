For PC/Linux target, the application executable is located in build/x86 folder.
To execute it, you have to go in the folder used to start the server application:
> cd  ../../server/build/
> ../../app_sac/build/x86/app_sac

For mips based embeded target, the application executable is located in build/mips folder.
