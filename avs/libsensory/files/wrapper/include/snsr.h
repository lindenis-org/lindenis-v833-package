/**
 * @addtogroup c C API
 * TrulyHandsfree C SDK.
 *
 * This library uses a [dataflow][] approach to evaluate speech
 * recognition tasks.
 * It relies on [inversion of control][ioc]:
 * User-defined hooks are invoked to report results and control task flow.
 * Task models define flow pipelines and behavior.
 * The API contains two primary data types: @ref session and @ref stream.
 * Sessions encapsulate the entire state of a task instance, and all
 * session input and output data are are vectored through streams.
 *
 * [dataflow]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming
 * [ioc]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control
 *
 * Session instance behavior is customized via settings, of which there
 * are three cariants:
 * - **Configuration** settings are serializable read-write values.
 *   These are used for parameter values and model objects.
 *   Task models contain reasonable default values - modify these only to
 *   tweak results.
 * - **Runtime** settings are instance-specific and not serializable. These
 *   include callback handles, iterators, input streams and values
 *   such as the name of the phrase being enrolled.
 * - **Result** settings are read-only values with very limited scope, such
 *   as the recognition results.
 *
 * Stream instances are created on various underlying data streams, such as
 * @c FILE @c * handles, memory segments, and live audio sources. Only the
 * constructors are type-specific, all other functions are independent of the
 * underlying stream type. Operations that take stream handles as arguments
 * operate on any of the types.
 *
 * Task evaluation typically follows this recipe:
 * - Create a new session instance.
 * - Load a task model into the instance.
 * - Set the input source stream.
 * - Register one or more event handlers.
 * - Enter the main loop. The library will process the input streams and
 *   invoke event handlers at appropriate times. The main loop continues
 *   until a terminating condition is reached, such as an event returning
 *   an error code.
 * - Release the sesion instance.
