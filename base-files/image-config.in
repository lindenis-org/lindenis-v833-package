menuconfig PREINITOPT
	bool "Preinit configuration options" if IMAGEOPT
	default n
	help
		These options are used to control the environment used to initialize
		the system before running init (which typically mean /sbin/init which
		switches to multiuser mode).

config TARGET_PREINIT_SUPPRESS_STDERR
	bool "Suppress stderr messages during preinit" if PREINITOPT
	default y
	help
		Sends stderr to null during preinit.  This is the default behaviour
		in previous versions of OpenWrt.  This also prevents init process
		itself from displaying stderr, however processes launched by init
		in multiuser through inittab will use the current terminal (e.g.
		the ash shell launched by inittab will display stderr).  That's
		the same behaviour as seen in previous version of OpenWrt.

config TARGET_PREINIT_TIMEOUT
	int
	prompt "Failsafe wait timeout" if PREINITOPT
	default 2
	help
		How long to wait for failsafe mode to be entered before
		continuing with a regular boot if failsafe not selected.

config TARGET_PREINIT_SHOW_NETMSG
	bool
	prompt "Show all preinit network messages" if PREINITOPT
	default n
	help
		Show preinit all network messages (via netmsg broadcast), not only
		the message indicating to press reset to enter failsafe.  Note that
		if the architecture doesn't define an interface, and there is no
		'Preinit network interface' defined, then no messages will be
		emitted, even if this is set.

config TARGET_PREINIT_SUPPRESS_FAILSAFE_NETMSG
	bool
	prompt "Suppress network message indicating failsafe" if PREINITOPT
	default n
	help
		If "Show all preinit network messages" above is not set, then
		setting this option suppresses the only message that would be
		emitted otherwise, name the network message to enter failsafe
		(via netmsg).

config TARGET_PREINIT_IFNAME
	string
	prompt "Preinit network interface" if PREINITOPT
	default ""
	help
		Interface for sending preinit messages to network, and any other
		default networking in failsafe or preinit.  If empty
		uses $ifname (if defined in /etc/preinit.arch).

config TARGET_PREINIT_IP
	string
	prompt "IP address for preinit network messages" if PREINITOPT
	default "192.168.1.1"
	help
		IP address used to configure interface for preinit network
		messages, including failsafe messages

config TARGET_PREINIT_NETMASK
	string
	prompt "Netmask for preinit network messages" if PREINITOPT
	default "255.255.255.0"
	help
		Netmask used to configure interface for preinit network
		messages, including failsafes messages

config TARGET_PREINIT_BROADCAST
	string
	prompt "Broadcast address for preinit network messages" if PREINITOPT
	default "192.168.1.255"
	help
		Broadcast address to which to send preinit network messages, as
		as failsafe messages


menuconfig INITOPT
	bool "Init configuration options" if IMAGEOPT
	default n
	help
		These option choose the command that will run as the 'init' command
		(that is which is responsible for controlling the system once preinit
		transfers control to it) as well as some options controlling its
		behaviour.  Normally init is /sbin/init.

	config TARGET_INIT_PATH
		string
		prompt "PATH for regular boot" if INITOPT
		default "/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"
		help
			Default PATH used during normal operation

	config TARGET_INIT_ENV
		string
		prompt "Environment variables to set when starting init (start with none)" if INITOPT
		default ""
		help
			Should be a space seperated list of variable assignments.  These
			variables will be present in the environment.  Spaces may not be
			present (including through expansion) even in a quoted string
			(env doesn't understanding quoting).

	config TARGET_INIT_CMD
		string
		prompt "Init command" if INITOPT
		default "/sbin/init"
		help
			The executable to run as the init process.  Is 'exec'd by
			preinit (which is the init that the kernel launches on boot).

	config TARGET_INIT_SUPPRESS_STDERR
		bool
		prompt "Suppress stderr messages of init" if INITOPT
		default y
		help
			Prevents showing stderr messages for init command if not already
			suppressed during preinit.  This is the default behaviour in
			previous versions of OpenWrt.  Removing this does nothing if
			stderr is suppressed during preinit (which is the default).


menuconfig PER_FEED_REPO
	bool "Separate feed repositories" if IMAGEOPT
	default y
	help
		If set, a separate repository is generated within bin/*/packages/
		for the core packages and each enabled feed.

	config PER_FEED_REPO_ADD_DISABLED
		bool "Add available but not enabled feeds to opkg.conf"
		default y
		depends on PER_FEED_REPO
		help
		  Add not installed or disabled feeds from feeds.conf to opkg.conf.

	config PER_FEED_REPO_ADD_COMMENTED
		bool "Comment out not enabled feeds"
		default y
		depends on PER_FEED_REPO && PER_FEED_REPO_ADD_DISABLED
		help
		  Add not enabled feeds as commented out source lines to opkg.conf.

menuconfig SMIMEOPT
	bool "Package signing options" if IMAGEOPT
        default n
	help
		These options configure the signing key and certificate to
		be used for signing and verifying packages.

	config OPKGSMIME_CERT
		string
		prompt "Path to certificate (PEM certificate format)" if SMIMEOPT
		help
		  Path to the certificate to use for signature verification

	config OPKGSMIME_KEY
		string
		prompt "Path to signing key (PEM private key format)" if SMIMEOPT
		help
		  Path to the key to use for signing packages

	config OPKGSMIME_PASSPHRASE
		bool
		default y
		prompt "Wait for a passphrase when signing packages?" if SMIMEOPT
		help
		  If this value is set, then the build will pause and request a passphrase
                  from the command line when signing packages. This SHOULD NOT be used with
                  automatic builds. If this value is not set, a file can be specified from
                  which the passphrase will be read.

	config OPKGSMIME_PASSFILE
		string
		prompt "Path to a file containing the passphrase" if SMIMEOPT
                depends on !OPKGSMIME_PASSPHRASE
		help
		  Path to a file containing the passphrase for the signing key.
                  If the signing key is not encrypted and does not require a passphrase,
                  this option may be left blank.
