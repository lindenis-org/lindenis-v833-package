1. OVERVIEW
  fbv (FrameBuffer Viewer) is a simple program to view pictures on a linux
framebuffer device. In 2000, when fbv was created, there were no other
situable programs performing the same task, so the authors decided to
follow the rule: 'If you need a tool - write it yourself!' :-)

2. REQUIREMENTS
  - Linux, configured to provide the framebuffer device interface
  - libjpeg for JPEG support
  - libpng for PNG support
  - build in BMP support

3. INSTALLATION
  - run ./configure
  - type: make
  - type: make install

4. USAGE
  Just run fbv without any arguments, and a short help message will appear.
